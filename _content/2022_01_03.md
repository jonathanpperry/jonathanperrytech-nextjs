Happy New Year!

Hope everyone had a nice end to 2021 of reflection, both on what went well in 2021 and what could be improved upon in the coming year.

Some take-aways for me:

- Recognize that a little progress every day is enough
- Accepting myself for who I am and who God made me to be
- God will work things out according to his timing, and that it's okay to release everything into His hands

Hope your new year gets off to a good start and see you in the next post!
