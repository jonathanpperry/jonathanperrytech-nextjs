October is wrapping up here in Japan.

I guess today is Halloween. I have some pretty fond memories in childhood of
dressing up with friends, going trick-or-treating. I feel like a lot of
this year has just been kind of spinning in circles, kind of making some
traction towards my dreams and visions, but also kind of going in circles as well.

I feel that the devil is constantly reminding me how selfish I am, how much I
tend only to care for my own interests, and not look out to the interests of others.
I am hoping this is something I will be able to change even before the end of this year.
I can't believe how sour and selfish my heart tends to be.

I wanted to update my blog with at least another post, and I would love to have
more original content be going out soon, so be on the lookout for that.
Until then, TRICK OR TREAT!!! SMELL MY FEET!!! GIVE ME SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT!
