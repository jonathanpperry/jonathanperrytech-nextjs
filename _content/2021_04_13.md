Welcome to my first post!

I have a separate website, but this specifically is a portfolio to
showcase specifically my technical projects, as a way to showcase and
demonstrate my technical ability.

Using Next.js in combination with Tailwind CSS is pretty sleek.
What is your favorite part of using tailwindcss?

Check out my other posts for links to my project and more technical
content. Cheers!
